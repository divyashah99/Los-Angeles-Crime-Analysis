# Los-Angeles-Crime-Analysis

## Objective:
In this project, the goal is to analyze a real-world dataset containing crime data from 2020 to the present. The primary objectives include cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and addressing specific questions related to crime trends, patterns, and factors influencing crime rates.

## Dataset:
The crime dataset for this project is available at Crime Data from 2020 to Present.

## Tasks:

### 1. Data Acquisition:
- Download the dataset from the provided link and load it into your preferred data analysis tool.

### 2. Data Inspection:
- Display the first few rows of the dataset.
- Check the data types of each column.
- Review column names and descriptions if available.

### 3. Data Cleaning:
- Identify and handle missing data appropriately.
- Check for and remove duplicate rows.
- Convert data types if needed (e.g., dates to date format, numerical values to appropriate numeric types).
- Deal with outliers if relevant to your analysis.
- Standardize or normalize numerical data as necessary.
- Encode categorical data if present.

### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Visualize overall crime trends from 2020 to the present year.
- Analyze and visualize seasonal patterns in crime data.
- Identify the most common type of crime and its trends over time.
- Investigate notable differences in crime rates between regions or cities.
- Explore correlations between economic factors (if available) and crime rates.
- Analyze the relationship between the day of the week and the frequency of certain types of crimes.
- Investigate any impact of major events or policy changes on crime rates.

### 5. Advanced Analysis:
- Use predictive modeling techniques (e.g., time series forecasting) to predict future crime trends.
- Explore additional questions or hypotheses related to the dataset.

## Questions to Solve:
1. **Overall Crime Trends:**
   - Calculate and plot the total number of crimes per year to visualize the trends.

2. **Seasonal Patterns:**
   - Group the data by month and analyze the average number of crimes per month over the years.

3. **Most Common Crime Type:**
   - Count the occurrences of each crime type and identify the one with the highest frequency.

4. **Regional Differences:**
   - Group the data by region or city and compare crime rates between them using descriptive statistics or visualizations.

5. **Correlation with Economic Factors:**
   - Collect economic data for the same time frame and use statistical methods like correlation analysis to assess the relationship between economic factors and crime rates.

6. **Day of the Week Analysis:**
   - Group the data by day of the week and analyze crime frequencies for each day.

7. **Impact of Major Events:**
   - Identify major events or policy changes during the dataset period and analyze crime rate changes before and after these events.

8. **Outliers and Anomalies:**
   - Use statistical methods or data visualization techniques to identify dataset outliers and investigate unusual patterns.

9. **Demographic Factors:**
   - Analyze the dataset to identify any patterns or correlations between demographic factors (e.g., age, gender) and specific types of crimes.

10. **Predicting Future Trends:**
    - Employ time series forecasting methods, such as ARIMA or Prophet, to predict future crime trends based on historical data. Consider incorporating relevant external factors into your models.
